# music-player-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [music-player-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/music-player-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a simple music player. Click the play button to play a music. There is a next button and a previous button. If we click the progress bar, where the current time is shown, we can rewind and fast forward.

## Key features

- In the display, it shows the title of the song, the artists of the song, the current time, the total duration of the song, a play button, a next button and a previous button.
- Use toggle functionality to switch between the play button and the pause button.
- Use the next button to loop through songs indefinitely.

### `yarn start`
